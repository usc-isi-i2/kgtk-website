  description: 'KGTK can be used to analyze financial transaction data. We will illustrate how to construct KGTK pipelines with graph transformations, analytics and visualization steps for the financial sector. The KGTK pipelines enable us to highlight trading behaviors, to find potential colluders, and to find inconsistencies through differentiating knowledge graph structures.',

  description: 'The recent advent of public large-scale research publications metadata repositories such as OpenAlex (Priem, Piwowar, and Orr 2022) enables us to study innovation at scales that have not been possible before. However, dealing with these large-scale repositories is extremely difficult and requires special toolkits. In this session, we will describe how KGTK can be used for data filtering, data transformation, knowledge graph extraction, and knowledge graph embedding training of knowledge graphs with scientific publications.',

  description: 'Our knowledge graph tools can be applied to make sense of complex events. Focused on a specific domain (or location) we track the changes in moral foundations (Johnson and Goldwasser 2018) and emotions to understand public perception of these events. The use of KGTK in this project makes it easy to scale up, to generalize to other domains and locations, and to browse and visualize the data.',
